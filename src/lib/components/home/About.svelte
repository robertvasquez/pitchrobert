                <p class="home-text">At my core, I’m someone who loves to build and create — whether it’s a piece of software, a drawing, or an idea brought to life. I’m driven by curiosity and compassion, always trying to understand the world a little better and leave it a little kinder. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me reading, experimenting with side projects, or planning my next creative challenge.</p>
